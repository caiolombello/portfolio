# üìÑ Dynamic llms.txt Documentation

This portfolio automatically generates a `llms.txt` file that provides LLMs (Large Language Models) with structured information about your portfolio content.

## ü§ñ What is llms.txt?

The `llms.txt` file is a standardized format that helps AI assistants and LLMs understand the structure and content of your portfolio website. It's automatically generated at `/llms.txt` and includes:

- **Professional profile information**
- **Project listings with descriptions**
- **Blog post summaries**
- **Technical skills**
- **Contact information**
- **Social media links**

## üîÑ Dynamic Generation

Unlike static `llms.txt` files, this portfolio generates the content dynamically by:

1. **Reading site configuration** from `config/site.json`
2. **Loading profile data** from `content/profile/profile.json`
3. **Scanning projects** from `content/projects/*.json`
4. **Indexing blog posts** from `content/posts/*.md`
5. **Listing skills** from `content/skills/skills.json`
