# Terraform Best Practices for Production

## Introduction

Terraform has become the de facto standard for Infrastructure as Code (IaC), allowing teams to define, provision, and manage infrastructure in a declarative way. However, using Terraform effectively in production environments requires more than just basic knowledge of the tool.

In this guide, we'll explore best practices for using Terraform in production, covering everything from state management to module organization and security considerations.

## State Management

Terraform state is a critical component that maps real-world resources to your configuration. Proper state management is essential for production environments.

### Remote State Storage

Never store state files locally or in version control. Instead, use remote backends like AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud Storage.

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "my-terraform-state"
    key            = "prod/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    encrypt        = true
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"
  }
}
```

### State Locking

Enable state locking to prevent concurrent modifications that could corrupt your state.

```hcl
# For AWS, use DynamoDB for locking
resource "aws_dynamodb_table" "terraform_locks" {
  name         = "terraform-locks"
  billing_mode = "PAY_PER_REQUEST"
  hash_key     = "LockID"

  attribute {
    name = "LockID"
    type = "S"
  }
}
```

### State Workspaces

Use workspaces to manage multiple environments (dev, staging, prod) with the same configuration.

```bash
# Create and select a workspace
terraform workspace new prod
terraform workspace select prod

# List workspaces
terraform workspace list
```

## Module Organization

Well-organized modules improve maintainability and reusability of your Terraform code.

### Module Structure

Follow a consistent structure for your modules:

```
module/
  ├── README.md           # Documentation
  ├── main.tf             # Main resources
  ├── variables.tf        # Input variables
  ├── outputs.tf          # Output values
  ├── versions.tf         # Required providers and versions
  └── examples/           # Example implementations
      └── basic/
          ├── main.tf
          └── variables.tf
```

### Versioning Modules

Version your modules using Git tags and reference specific versions in your configurations.

```hcl
module "vpc" {
  source  = "git::https://github.com/company/terraform-aws-vpc.git?ref=v1.2.0"
  # or for public modules
  # source  = "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"
  # version = "3.14.0"
  
  name = "my-vpc"
  # other parameters...
}
```

## Security Best Practices

Security should be a top priority when using Terraform in production.

### Sensitive Data Handling

Never hardcode sensitive data in your Terraform files. Use variables marked as sensitive and provide values through environment variables or secure vaults.

```hcl
variable "database_password" {
  description = "Password for the database"
  type        = string
  sensitive   = true
}
```

### Least Privilege Principle

Ensure that the service account or user running Terraform has only the permissions necessary to create and manage the resources defined in your configuration.

### Security Scanning

Implement security scanning tools like tfsec, checkov, or Terraform Sentinel to identify security issues in your Terraform code.

```bash
# Example using tfsec
tfsec .

# Example using checkov
checkov -d .
```

## Operational Excellence

### Consistent Formatting

Use `terraform fmt` to ensure consistent formatting across all your Terraform files.

```bash
# Format all files in the current directory
terraform fmt
```

### Validation

Always validate your configurations before applying them.

```bash
terraform validate
```

### Plan Review

Always review the execution plan before applying changes, especially in production environments.

```bash
terraform plan -out=tfplan
terraform show -json tfplan > tfplan.json
```
