# Kubernetes HPA: Custom Metrics for Autoscaling

## Introduction

Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) is a powerful feature that allows you to automatically scale your applications based on resource utilization. By default, HPA can scale based on CPU and memory usage, but what if you want to scale based on custom metrics specific to your application?

In this article, we'll explore how to set up custom metrics for Kubernetes HPA, allowing you to scale your applications based on metrics that truly matter to your business.

## Understanding Custom Metrics

Custom metrics in Kubernetes allow you to scale your applications based on metrics that are specific to your application or business needs. These could include:

- Number of requests per second
- Queue length
- Response time
- Business-specific metrics like number of active users

By using custom metrics, you can create more intelligent scaling policies that better reflect the actual load on your application.

## Setting Up Custom Metrics

To use custom metrics with HPA, you'll need to set up a few components:

1. **Prometheus**: To collect and store metrics
2. **Prometheus Adapter**: To expose Prometheus metrics to the Kubernetes API
3. **Custom Metrics API**: To allow HPA to access the custom metrics

### Step 1: Install Prometheus

```yaml
# prometheus-values.yaml
serverFiles:
  prometheus.yml:
    scrape_configs:
      - job_name: 'kubernetes-pods'
        kubernetes_sd_configs:
          - role: pod
        relabel_configs:
          - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_annotation_prometheus_io_scrape]
            action: keep
            regex: true
```

### Step 2: Install Prometheus Adapter

```yaml
# adapter-values.yaml
rules:
  default: false
  custom:
    - seriesQuery: 'http_requests_total{namespace!="",pod!=""}'
      resources:
        overrides:
          namespace:
            resource: namespace
          pod:
            resource: pod
      name:
        matches: "^(.*)_total"
        as: "\\1_per_second"
      metricsQuery: 'sum(rate(<<.Series>>{<<.LabelMatchers>>}[2m])) by (<<.GroupBy>>)'
```

### Step 3: Create an HPA with Custom Metrics

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: my-app-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: my-app
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
  - type: Pods
    pods:
      metric:
        name: http_requests_per_second
      target:
        type: AverageValue
        averageValue: 100
```

## Conclusion

By leveraging custom metrics with Kubernetes HPA, you can create more intelligent scaling policies that better reflect the actual load on your application. This allows you to optimize resource usage and ensure that your application can handle varying levels of traffic efficiently.

Remember that the key to effective autoscaling is choosing the right metrics that truly reflect the load on your application. Take the time to identify these metrics and set appropriate thresholds to ensure optimal performance.
